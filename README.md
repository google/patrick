# Introducing patrick

This package is an extension to `testthat` that enables parameterized unit
testing in R.

## Installing

The release version of `patrick` is available on CRAN. Install it in the usual
manner:

```
install.packages("patrick")
```

The development version of `patrick` is currently only available on GitHub.
Install it using `devtools`.

```
devtools::install_github("google/patrick")
```

To use `patrick` as a testing tool within your package, add it to your list of
`Suggests` within your package's `DESCRIPTION`.

```
Suggests:
    patrick
```

## Use

Many packages within R employ the following pattern when writing tests:

```
test_that("Data is a successfully converted: numeric", {
  input <- convert(numeric_data)
  expect_type(input, "double")
})

test_that("Data is a successfully converted: character", {
  input <- convert(character_data)
  expect_type(input, "character")
})
```

While explicit, recycling a test pattern like this is prone to user error and
other issues, as it is a violation of the classic DNRY rule (do not repeat
yourself). `patrick` eliminates this problem by creating test parameters.

```
test_these("Data is successfully converted:", {
    input <- convert(test_data)
    expect_type(input, type)
  },
  test_data = list(numeric_data, character_data),
  type = c("double", "character"),
  .test_name = type
)
```

Parameterized tests behave exactly the same as standard `testthat` tests. Per
usual, you call all of your tests with `devtools::test`, and they'll also run
during package checks. Each executes independently and then your test report
will produce a single report. A complete name for each test will be formed using
the initial test description and the strings in the `.test_name` parameter.

Small sets of cases can be reasonably passed as parameters to
`test_these`. This becomes less readable when the number of cases
increases. To help mitigate this issue, `patrick` provides a case generator
helper function.

```
test_these("Data is successfully converted:", {
    input <- convert(test_data)
    expect_type(input, type)
  },
  cases(
    double = list(test_data = numeric_data, type = "double"),
    character = list(test_data = character_data, type = "character")
  )
)
```

More complicated testing cases can be constructed using data frames. This is
usually best handled within a helper function and in a `helper-<test>.R` file.

```
make_cases <- function() {
  tibble::tribble(
    ~ .test_name, ~ expr,      ~ numeric_value,
    "sin",       sin(pi / 4),     1 / sqrt(2),
    "cos",       cos(pi / 4),     1 / sqrt(2),
    "tan",       tan(pi / 4),               1
  )
}

test_these(
  "trigonometric functions match identities",
  {
    testthat::expect_equal(expr, numeric_value)
  },
  .cases = make_cases()
)
```

If you don't provide test names when generating cases, `patrick` will generate
them automatically from the test data.

## Inspiration

This package is inspired by parameterized testing packages in other languages,
notably the [`parameterized`](https://github.com/wolever/parameterized) library
in Python.
